# SimpleML-App

This is an implementation of a [Iris plant](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=36&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj3wNDE2fHlAhWOZd8KHc4GD4sQmhMwI3oECA4QAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FIris_(plant)&usg=AOvVaw0ZZWPXe5xpUxEskckOA0ER) classifier using Flask and React.

# How to use it
To run it first clone the repository and run the front end
But before that make sure your node version is up to date
  `$ git clone https://github.com/ghostbill/SimpleML-App`
 ```$ cd SimpleML-APP 
    $ python -m venv venv
    $ cd front/
    $ npm install
    $ npm run
 ```
 After this your front end should be running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

To run the backend execute the following commands from the root of the app:
  ```
  cd back/
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  python3 app.py
  ```
 You can now go back to your browser and test it :)
